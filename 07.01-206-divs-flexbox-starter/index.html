                <h5>The secret to happiness is simple. It is based on a famous quote by professor and political figure Reinhold Niebuhr, “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.” How can you implement this principle? Follow these 3 steps.</h5>

                <h3>Step 1:</h3>
                <h4>Identify sources of unhappiness.</h4>
                <p>Make a list of everything in your life that causes you unhappiness or dissatisfaction.  Once you have developed your list, use a second piece of paper to organize your list from top to bottom in terms of what causes you the greatest unhappiness (at the top) to the least unhappiness (at the bottom). Look at your ordered list and put a minus sign (-) in front of items you cannot change—things that are not under your control—and put a plus sign (+) next to items that you can change—things that are under your control.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <h3>Step 2:</h3>
                <h4>Accept what you cannot change.</h4>
                <p>In reading through these items, you might decide that some can be turned into plus signs, which is great. But in the end, some will be left sitting there as things you cannot change. Your goal is to make peace with these things. Realize that stressors are put in your life for a reason. We grow from facing difficulties; we become our best selves. Rather than feeling upset about the things you cannot change, feel grateful. Each challenge presents a lesson to be learned. What is the underlying lesson?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
              <h3>Step 3:</h3>
              <h4>Change what is under your control.</h4>
              <p>Each item on your “changeable” list will require its own unique solution. Simply writing down the things you wish to change will bring you part of the way there. The remaining part may require a great deal of effort, energy, and determination. Given that your list is ordered from most to least influential, you might first tackle an item near the top for the greatest impact.</p>
